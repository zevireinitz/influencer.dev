# Dev Influencer Directory 
The world's leading dev influencer database

# TL;DR
Lots of developers create good content and have built niche audiences. Many of them are looking for collaboration opportunities.

Lots of companies/makers look for the right people to help them promote their dev-focused product or tool.

_**It's hard for each of these two groups to find what they're looking for.**_

That's why I've started this project. It's an open-source database of dev influencers (people who have built an audience for their dev-centric content). My hope is that this will make it easier for the content creators to promote their work and make it easier for the companies/builders to find the right partners for promoting their products. 

# **How it works**
- If you create content for developers and you're open to collaborations - add yourself to the list below.
- If you're looking for someone to create dev-centric content for/about your company or product - check out the list below.

# **Who is a "Dev Influencer"?**
For the purposes of this project, you are a dev-influencer if:
- You are currently and consistently creating quality content for developers (you need to be able to show off your work to other people)
- You have specific technical areas of expertise that you focus on with your content
- You publish your content on mainstream platforms under your personal name/brand (and not as a ghostwriter)
- You are interested in working with brands/companies to create content related to their dev-focused products

# What the columns mean

- **Profile Picture** = A link to a profile picture
- **Name** = Name + Github profile link
- **Niche** = The main topics they like to talk about
- **Audience** = Total (estimated) number of followers/subscribers across their main channels
- **Channels** = The main channels used for pushing content
- **Link** = A link to their main landing page with more information about their services and collaboration opportunities
