# Welcome to influencer.dev ðŸ‘‹

This is a directory of "Dev Influencers" - technical people who create quality content for a technical audience. 
- If you create content for developers and you're open to collaborations - you belong on the list below.
- If you're looking for someone to create technical, dev-centric content for/about your company or product - check out the list below.

# Why we built this
Lots of developers create good content and have built niche audiences. Many of them are looking for collaboration opportunities.

Lots of companies/makers look for the right people to help them promote their dev-focused product or tool.

_**It's hard for each of these two groups to find what they're looking for.**_

That's why I've started this project. It's an open-source database of dev influencers (people who have built an audience for their dev-centric content). My hope is that this will make it easier for the content creators to promote their work and make it easier for the companies/builders to find the right partners for promoting their products. 

# **Who is a "Dev Influencer"?**
You are a dev-influencer if you check the following boxes:
- âœ… You are currently and consistently creating quality content for developers (you need to be able to show off your work to other people)
- âœ… You have specific technical areas of expertise that you focus on with your content
- âœ… You publish your content on mainstream platforms under your personal name/brand (and not as a ghostwriter)
- âœ… You are interested in working with brands/companies to create content related to their dev-focused products

# What the columns mean

- **Name** = Name + Github profile link
- **Focus** = The main topics they like to talk about
- **Audience** = Total (estimated) number of followers/subscribers across their main channels
- **Channels** = The main channels used for pushing content
- **Link** = A link to their main landing page with more information about their services and collaboration opportunities
