# Welcome to influencer.dev üëã

**influencer.dev is a directory of "Dev Influencers" (technical humans who create quality content for their dev-centric audience).**
- If you create content for developers and you're open to collaborations - you belong on the list below.
- If you're looking for someone to create technical, dev-centric content for/about your company or product - check out the list below.

# Why We Built This
Lots of technical folks have built niche audiences around their content (making them "dev influencers"). Many of these influencers are alo open to collaborations.

At the same time, lots of brands are looking for the right influencers and content creators to review and promote their dev-focused products.

_**But it's hard for these two groups to find each other.**_

That's the problem we're solving with influencer.dev - an open-source marketplace for dev influencer collaboration. It allows technical content creators to promote themselves to relevant brands and it enables brands to easily connect with the most relevant creators for their target audience.

# What the columns mean

- **Name** = Name + Github profile link
- **Focus** = The main topics they like to talk about
- **Audience** = Total (estimated) number of followers/subscribers across their main channels
- **Channels** = The main channels used for pushing content (there might be more than what you see here)
- **Link** = A link to their main landing page with more information about their services and collaboration opportunities

# Why Dev Influencers are Important
Simply put - dev influencers are important because developers appreciate _**authenticity**_. 

This list is a collection of humans who have built an audience (big or small) and earned a reputation for their expertise in a specific area. Their ability to speak with clarity, authority, and consistency about a particular topic makes them trusted advisors to the people who consume their content. 

Connecting with the right influencer can help brands/companies in several ways:
- Get pro-grade product feedback 
- Introduce products to a niche target audience in a trusted, non-'salesy' way
- Generate authentic testimonials and product reviews
- And more...
