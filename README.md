# Welcome to influencer.dev ðŸ‘‹

This is a directory of "Dev Influencers" - technical people who create quality content for a technical audience. 
- If you create content for developers and you're open to collaborations - you belong on the list below.
- If you're looking for someone to create technical, dev-centric content for/about your company or product - check out the list below.

# Why we built this
Lots of technical folks have built niche audiences around their content (making them "dev influencers"). Many of these influencers are open to collaborations.

Lots of companies are looking for the right influencers and content creators to review and promote their dev-focused products.

_**But it's hard for these two groups to find each other.**_

That's the problem we're solving with influencer.dev - a growing database of dev influencers. It's an open-source marketplace that allows technical influencers/content creators to promote themselves and makes it easy for companies/builders to connect with the creators most relevant to their target audience.
