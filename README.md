# Welcome to influencer.dev 👋

This is a directory of "Dev Influencers" - technical people who create quality content for a technical audience. 
- If you create content for developers and you're open to collaborations - you belong on the list below.
- If you're looking for someone to create technical, dev-centric content for/about your company or product - check out the list below.

# Why we built this
Lots of technical folks have built niche audiences around their content. Many of these folks are open to collaborations.
Lots of companies look for the right influencers and content creators to help them review and promote their dev-focused products.

_**But there's no good way for these two groups to find each other.**_

This project aims to solve that problem by maintaining an open-source database of dev influencers. This allows technical influencers/content creators to promote themselves and it makes it much easier for the companies/builders to find the relevant influencer partners. It's a marketplace that should be a win-win for everyone involved.

# **Who is a "Dev Influencer"?**
You are a dev-influencer if you check the following boxes:
- ✅ You are currently and consistently creating quality content for developers (you need to be able to show off your work to other people)
- ✅ You have specific technical areas of expertise that you focus on with your content
- ✅ You publish your content on mainstream platforms under your personal name/brand (and not as a ghostwriter)
- ✅ You are interested in working with brands/companies to create content related to their dev-focused products

# What the columns mean

- **Name** = Name + Github profile link
- **Focus** = The main topics they like to talk about
- **Audience** = Total (estimated) number of followers/subscribers across their main channels
- **Channels** = The main channels used for pushing content
- **Link** = A link to their main landing page with more information about their services and collaboration opportunities
